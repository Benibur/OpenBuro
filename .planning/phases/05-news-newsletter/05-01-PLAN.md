<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add News Section with 3 Article Cards</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Add News section to index.html after the Ecosystem section (before Newsletter section).

**Section structure:**
- Section with id="news" for anchor navigation
- "ACTUALITES" badge (consistent with other section badges)
- H2 title: "Dernières nouvelles" or "Latest News"
- Container with responsive article card grid

**Article cards layout:**
- Mobile: Horizontal scroll with flex layout (overflow-x-auto, flex-nowrap)
- Desktop (md breakpoint): Grid layout with 3 columns (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3)
- Gap between cards: gap-6

**Each of 3 article cards contains:**
1. Gradient placeholder image (aspect ratio 16:9, bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-600 or similar dark mode compatible gradients - vary gradients across the 3 cards)
2. Date tag positioned over image (absolute positioning, top-right or top-left, small badge style)
3. Title (H3, font-semibold)
4. Excerpt (2 lines max, text-muted, line-clamp-2)
5. "Read" or "Lire la suite" link with arrow icon

**3 Hardcoded articles (per planning context):**
1. Title: "Open Buro Website Launch", Date: "Feb 2026", Excerpt: "Discover our new landing page showcasing the Open Buro standard and Alliance mission."
2. Title: "Open Buro Presented at FOSDEM 2025", Date: "Jan 2025", Excerpt: "The project was introduced to the open source community at Europe's largest developer conference."
3. Title: "La Suite numerique & Twake: Genesis of a Standard", Date: "2025", Excerpt: "How collaboration between French government and LINAGORA created the foundation for Open Buro."

**Styling:**
- Use existing design system: dark mode palette, card styles with border, hover effects
- Cards should have subtle border (border-slate-800), rounded corners (rounded-lg)
- Hover state: slight elevation (translateY -2px) and border color change (border-blue-500)
- Maintain 6rem vertical section padding (3rem on mobile) consistent with other sections
- Container max-width 1200px centered

**Accessibility:**
- Proper heading hierarchy (H2 for section, H3 for article titles)
- Article cards wrapped in semantic article or a tags with descriptive aria-labels if needed
  </action>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Newsletter Section with Email Form and GDPR Compliance</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>

**Form elements:**
- Form tag with action="#" placeholder (configurable for future email service integration)
- Method POST

  - required attribute
  - placeholder="your.email@example.com" or similar
  - Styled with design system: dark background, border, focus ring (blue accent)

- Submit button:
  - Primary button style (matches "Join the Alliance" CTA buttons from other sections)
  - Text: "Subscribe" or "S'abonner"

- Small text (text-sm, text-muted)
- Content: "By subscribing, you agree to receive occasional updates about Open Buro. We respect your privacy and will never share your email address. You can unsubscribe at any time."
- No checkbox required for opt-in (simpler UX, email submission implies consent per text)

**Styling:**
- Section background: subtle differentiation (slightly lighter/darker than default or subtle gradient)

- Section padding: 6rem vertical (3rem mobile)
