## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Single HTML file (no build step): Maximum deployability, simplest hosting
- Canvas animation for hero (not CSS SVG): More dynamic/impressive network effect, acceptable JS weight
- Tailwind via CDN (not local): No build step, rapid prototyping
- English content (overriding PRD's French default): Broader European audience reach
- Text placeholders for partner logos: No logo files available yet, swap later
- [Phase 01]: English content with French badges for brand identity (broader European reach)
- [Phase 01]: Inline SVG favicon for zero external asset dependencies
- [Phase 01]: Layered CSS token system (primitive → semantic → component) for maintainable theming
- [Phase 01]: Inline blocking script for FOUC prevention (only acceptable blocking script)
- [Phase 01]: Transform-based animations to avoid layout thrashing
